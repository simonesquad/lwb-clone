# About to be released...

This website was a long time coming. About 15 years since my grandfather had his own website up on the way-way back machine. 
This will be the official landing page of Louis W. Ballard music going forward. I wrote the copy and designed the react app front-end using Chakra-UI. For now there is no back-end but if music rentals/sales occur on this website in the future then functionality will be extended. 


Comments and suggestions are always welcome through the contact form.
